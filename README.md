## Database Schema

The system uses a hierarchical structure with 11 models:

- **Zone** → Multiple Groups
- **Group** → Multiple Churches  
- **Church** → Transactions & Payments
- **Department** → Product Types & Campaign Categories
- **Transaction** → Line Items (product quantities)
- **Payment** → Financial records with optional campaign linking
- **CampaignCategory** → Campaign tracking (auto-generated or manual)
- **UploadHistory** → CSV upload audit trail

## CSV Upload Format

The system accepts CSV files with the following format:

```csv
Church Name,Date,Product Type,Quantity,Unit Price,Payment Amount,Payment Method
LW BIRMINGHAM,2024-01-15,ROR English,2500,2.50,6250.00,BANK_TRANSFER
```

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run lint         # Run ESLint
npm run db:push      # Push schema changes to database
npm run db:migrate   # Create migration
npm run db:studio    # Open Prisma Studio
npm run db:seed      # Seed database with initial data
```

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy!

Vercel will automatically:
- Install dependencies
- Run Prisma generate
- Build the Next.js app
- Deploy to production

## Security Features

- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT-based session management
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Row-level security in database queries
- ✅ Input validation with Zod
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS encryption in transit
- ✅ Database encryption at rest
- ✅ Audit logging for all uploads

## Deployment to Production

### Prerequisites

1. **Database**: Set up a production PostgreSQL database (e.g., Neon, Supabase, Railway)
2. **Vercel Account**: Create an account at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. **Environment Variables**: Prepare your production environment variables

### Step 1: Prepare Database

```bash
# Connect to your production database
DATABASE_URL="your-production-database-url"

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed initial data (zones, groups, churches)
npm run db:seed
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

**Via Vercel Dashboard:**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Import your Git repository
4. Add environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Your production database URL
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your production URL (e.g., `https://nexus-reporthub.vercel.app`)
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` - "Nexus ReportHub"
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your production URL
5. Click **Deploy**

**Via Vercel CLI:**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Add environment variables
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET
vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL
```

### Step 3: Post-Deployment

1. **Verify Deployment**: Visit your production URL and test login
2. **Create Admin Users**: Use the seeded admin account or create new users
3. **Configure Monitoring**: Set up error tracking (optional, Sentry recommended)
4. **Enable Analytics**: Configure Vercel Analytics (optional)
5. **Custom Domain**: Add your custom domain in Vercel settings (optional)

### Step 4: Database Migrations

For future schema changes:

```bash
# Create a migration
npm run db:migrate

# Deploy migration to production
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Build fails**: Check Node.js version (18+ required)
- **Database connection errors**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` format and credentials
- **Authentication issues**: Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and `NEXTAUTH_URL` are set correctly
- **Missing tables**: Run `npx prisma migrate deploy` to apply migrations
